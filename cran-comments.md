## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.

There were two comments to address:

> If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file

The methods implemented in the package are not tied to a particular research 
paper, hence there is no obvious reference to cite. 

> We do not need "+ file LICENSE" and the file as these are part of R.

"| file LICENSE" has been removed from the DESCRIPTION file, and the LICENSE 
file has been removed from the package source.
